# SpawnPlus
A plugin for setting priority of spawn points for player to respawn and login-teleport.  
- three types of spawn point provided
- players will spawn at default spawn points if they have no own spawn points.
- players will spawn at group spawn points if they have no own spawn points.
- players will spawn at default spawn points if they do not have both of own and group spawn points.
- spawn priority: local(user) > group > default
- available to enable tp-login feature.
- you can set single-world-only function.
- I highly recommend you to view Wiki.
