## About SpawnPlus

## Description
SpawnPlus is a plugin for you to set the priority of spawn points for each player.  
For the spawning points, there are three types of priorities, default, group and local.  
If players have local spawn points set, they can respawn or login-teleport on that location,
instead if players don't have local spawn points but group spawn points, group spawn points would be selected for the 
teleporting. Otherwise, if none of local and group set, default spawn point would be last choice to respawn or login-teleport.  

## Version Support
